Last week, you focused on **Probability**—the mathematics of chance. This assignment will guide you through the process of correctly gathering data (**sampling**), visualizing it (**distributions**), and summarizing it numerically (**summary statistics**). As always, your AI assistant is here to help you explore these concepts and prepare for hands-on practice in class. Let's dive in!\n",
